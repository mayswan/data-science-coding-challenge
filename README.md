# data-science-coding-challenge


## Description
This project is dedicated to the present my work on the Zeiss coding challenge. 

I found the challenges very motivating and examined both datasets. 

If you only want to look at one of the projects, please refer to my work on the customer leads generation dataset in folder "b_customer_data_lead_generator"

## Software used and file format
I used anaconda cloud services and their Jupyter Notebook.
The advantage for a small project like this is that python and its all necessary packages are already available.
Therefore, the files are in .ipynb format.

## Requirements
- python_version 3.11.5
- pandas version 2.0.3
- matplotlib version 3.7.2
- seaborn version 0.12.2
- sklearn_version 1.3.0
